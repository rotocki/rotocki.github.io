<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Making first steps in a virtual environment</a></h2>
<p>I've done a little bit of reading to see if it is possible to setup
my own GitHub page without having to resort to Ruby/Jekyll since
I'm much more comfortable with doing stuff in Python.</p>
<p>As I'm trying to use a bit more restructuredText to eventually write
all of my documentation for Python code in a syntax that is Sphinx-friendly,
I wanted to have that option to write the content in rst files instead of
plain HTML.</p>
<p>Given the assumptions above, I decided to use Pelican and see how far
will I get with it. First step was to install it and see how many other
plugins and/or dependencies will I need to get the job done.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to install all the dependencies in a virtual
environment so that if this experiment fails, I can just remove
the folder with the environment in it instead of going through
dependencies in my system and cleaning them one by one.</p>
<p>As I've been installing a typical virtual environment, an idea came to my mind.
I was about to create a project which focuses on doing one thing only while being run
always in the same environment is the ideal definition of an application.
Since there is a great tool to keep all dependencies for an application
in a controlled fashion, I thought about managing it using <cite>pipenv</cite> instead.
I've used it in the past for a bit but never really committed to it.
Because this idea sounded like a good one, I decided to run with it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install pipenv
pipenv install pelican
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-the-project-and-figuring-out-its-structure">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Creating the project and figuring out its structure</a></h2>
<p>After installing Pelican in the virtual environment, I checked how to start
the project rolling. Fortunately, there is a quickstart step similar to the one
you can find in Sphinx.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run pelican-quickstart
</pre></div>
<p>I've configured the project in such a way that I customized the title,
author and made sure that it correctly refers to my GitHub page.</p>
<p>Once the quickstart was done, I looked at the structure of the project.
I created a simple <strong>About me</strong> page under <tt class="docutils literal">content/pages/about.rst</tt>
and this blog post under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content/blog/first-steps-with-pelican-to-set-up-this-github-page.rst</span></tt>.
I followed the typical <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/content.html#file-metadata">File metadata</a> structure for the blog post
and a simplified version for <strong>About me</strong> page.</p>
<p>After that everything should be simple, right?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run pelican
</pre></div>
<p>I've looked at the generated HTML files stored in output folder in project's default path.
To my surprise, opening just the <cite>index.html</cite> file wasn't as pleasant as I expected,
since all of the other static content like CSS were not collected by the browser.
Opening checking the documentation, I've noticed that I was supposed to serve the pages
on web server instead of just browsing them directly. Sounds logical. The immediate
suggestion was to do it by moving to output directory and running HTTP server
from Python 3's standard library:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/content $ python -m http.server
</pre></div>
<p>After that, I just opened my browser and checked the page served as <tt class="docutils literal">localhost:8000</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simplifying-serving-procedure-with-invoke-and-its-tasks">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Simplifying serving procedure with invoke and its tasks</a></h2>
<p>The page worked correctly but I was not satisfied with this approach as it seemed error-prone.
First I needed to make sure that I'm inside a correct folder and then remember to invoke
<cite>server</cite> module from <cite>http</cite> library. So I looked for another approach in the files autogenerated
by pelican with quickstart procedure.</p>
<p>Since I've worked a bit with <cite>invoke</cite> package and used fabfiles in the past,
I immediately noticed <cite>tasks.py</cite> file in main directory of the project.
After skimming through the code, I found <cite>build</cite> and <cite>serve</cite> tasks which would enable me
to generate and serve output files without needing to think about platform/OS on which the tasks
would have to be run on. This sounded great as I'm using Windows whenever I can and resort to
Linux virtual machine only if I have to suffer the performance hit.</p>
<p>To use this approach, I had to install <cite>invoke</cite> package:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv install invoke
</pre></div>
<p>After that, the procedure to run invoke tasks was wonderfully simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run invoke build
pipenv run invoke serve
</pre></div>
<p>Can we make it shorter? Sure!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run inv reserve
</pre></div>
<p>Nice!</p>
